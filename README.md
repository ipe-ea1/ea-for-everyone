# EA for Everyone

## What has EA done for me lately?

## Questions or Answers?

Why questions of course, young and aspiring Enterprise Architects.  Knowing things is important.  After all, the EA Viking drinks coffee and knows things.  However, if you ask the wrong questions, do the answers really matter all that much?

EA is the CONTEXT engine for enterprises and organizations of all stripes.  Forget that fancy MCP server and your RAG nonsense, and all the self training, self learning, congratulatory LLM, RLM, SLM, and all the other LMs out there.  At the end of the day context is king.  We are in the business of context.  To generate context that has any value you have to ask good questions and understand how to create relationships (in a Graph data store please - nodes and edges are our friends) from the answers.  Once these relationships are formed you can start to see patterns that provide insight into all manner of important nonsense.  Think strategic objectives, business contexts, capabilities, initiatives in the big money portfolio ePMO is always yapping about, your whole darn application stack, the shared infrastructure (compute this, storage that, integration & middleware anybody, some databases thrown in with a bit of cache, me thinks I digress), and maybe some TBM categories thrown in for good measure.

## Meta-Models because Models need help too

Why always Meta.  Isn't the insufferable Mark with all his terrible applications designed to productize humanity and keep us ignorant, angry (usually go together - being stupid is hard), and tribal forced into our lives enough?  Do we really need more Meta?  Those are deep philosophical questions that deserve answers, but, we are not talking about that META.

We need meta-models because, we deal in abstractions.  Without taxonomy, descriptors, tags (so many TAGS), relationships, and semantic feel good movies nobody but nobody would have any idea what we are talking about.  So go out and find one that works for you.  There are dozens, if not hundreds out there to choose from.  Zi Germans have some good ones, the Zachman's don't - framework but not really, the Gartner (yes the gray suites - they do some ok work from time to time), and even the mighty TOGAFFFFFFFFFFF.  Choose the one that works for your use cases and business.  However, remember they are just a model for an abstraction.  So use the bits that add value and skip the bits that don't.
